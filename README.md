## Descrption
Use everything we’ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, and the
Fetch API to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini
models to show more content / data about that model.

Create a multi-table relational database using phpAdmin that will be used to store 
information about a mini vehicle and it’s 3 model types. Consider what information would be relevant in 
order to inform the user about what makes each model type different and what features are available.

## Requirements
Create an AJAX request for the mini data housed in a local JSON object using the Fetch API.
Use that application state to build out your application’s view (the mini app splash/home page).

## Optional 
Use components: each car should be a component, with its own data. There should
be additional videos to view at this stage as well. Create some additional UI where appropriate.
